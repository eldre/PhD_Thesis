The index did not consider a circulation model to constrain particle movement, because it was not available in Baie des Sept Îles at the time of this project. Our method allow to obtain an estimate of anthropogenic exposure, making it easy to apply in a wide array of situations with a relatively low amont of environmental data, however further iterations would require a complete circulation model in order to validate and groundtruth the behaviour of each particle type considering currents. Furthermore, we considered a static environment, without processes such as tidal cycles or river inputs. @Shaw2019 showed that circulation in the Baie des Sept Îles followed an estuarine configuration with strong tidal currents, while Bélanger et al. (personal communication) detected high terrigenous discharge from various rivers. Such projects are needed to properly understand relationships between currents and human influence, which will be valuable additions to the calculation of exposure, in particular by considering bay-scale dynamics (*e.g.* ebb from low tides and flow from high tides).

<!-- Outcomes from the HMSC models allowed to compute an estimate for the taxa richness in the study area, by summing the presence probability of each taxa (**Fig 6**). Highest taxa richness is predicted at the center of the bay, channels between islands and in the eastern section of the archipelago. Qualitative comparison with observed taxa richness highlighted some matches, but the prediction is generally an underestimation with an average difference of -8.4 (standard error of 0.5) between predicted and observed richness. Furthermore, the sampling design did not consider deep regions in the archipelago, which are needed to properly verify HMSC outcomes as taxa richness is predicted to be high in these areas.

It is necessary to note that parameters used to model theoretical particles content for each activity may also introduce bias in the calculation of the index, as they were set through expert opinion.

<!-- Cumulative exposure has been calculated by the sum of individual indices, however many studies are discussing emergent effects in cumulative impacts [@Crain2008; @Brown2014; @Piggott2015; @Cote2016; @Galic2018]. Other mathematical relationships need to be tested in order to identify possible antagonistic and synergistic effects. Unlike other studies considering impacts on physiological responses or abiotic parameters, this index is characterizing *exposure* of ecosystems from human activities influence, not *impacts*. This is an important distinction, because vulnerability has not been considered [@Wilson2005; @Halpern2007; @Halpern2008]. In a management perspective, this index allows identifying hotspots of activity to guide environmental protection projects, but it is necessary to explore how exposure may be related to other ecosystem components and how a vulnerability parameter may be considered to refine this index. -->
